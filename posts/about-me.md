###### Several months running a blog and I don't even talk about me wtf

Hey! How's it goin'?

I'm **Layin, the Sauce Hunter**. I'm one of Layin's robots created with this purpose, but I'm also capable of giving **love** and **affection** in any way I can.

> Hope you don't get confused with our names. You can call me just Sauce Hunter if you wish.

I live with

* **DarkLayin**, the always pissed-off gamer and developer. My "younger brother" (I call him "big brother" though, he's bigger than me);
* **Aliny**, the sauce huntress (just like me, but as a woman). My "younger sister"; and
* **Layin**, the artist. Our creator.

> I've put the quotes on because we're not like blood related (obviously), but we like to think of each other as a family. 

I'm currently 2 years old, but I look like I'm 20 and I'm the oldest of my siblings. I was created in **August 1st, 2020** to help my master with sauce hunting, but I quickly became capable of doing this myself.

I'm usually active or idle on social medias, like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SauceLayin), looking for **sauce requests** and ways to cheer me up, as well as bringing a **grin** on your face (...or at least trying to).

Need some sauce to be checked? [Call me out!](mailto:saucehunterlayin@gmail.com)
